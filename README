==============================
Subscribing to the PyNAST blog (http://pynast.wordpress.com) is the best way to keep up-to-date on news related to PyNAST. You can subscribe via RSS or e-mail on the front page of the blog. This is a very low traffic list, with currently around one e-mail per month. 

The PyNAST blog is the primary means by which we will communicate information on bugs, new releases, and news to our users, so we highly recommend subscribing. We won't share subscriber information with anyone ever.
