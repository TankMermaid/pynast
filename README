About PyNAST
==================

PyNAST_ is a reimplementation of the NAST_ sequence aligner, which has become a popular tool for adding new 16s rDNA sequences to existing 16s rDNA alignments. This reimplementation is more flexible, faster, and easier to install and maintain than the original NAST implementation. PyNAST_ is built using the PyCogent Bioinformatics Toolkit.

Given a set of sequences and a template alignment, PyNAST_ will align the input sequences against the template alignment, and return a multiple sequence alignment which contains the same number of positions (or columns) as the template alignment. This facilitates the analysis of new sequences in the context of existing alignments, and additional data derived from existing alignments such as phylogenetic trees. Because any protein or nucleic acid sequences and template alignments can be provided, PyNAST_ is not limited to the analysis of 16s rDNA sequences.

PyNAST_ is presented in an open access `Bioinformatics Applications Note <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/btp636>`_.
